  + Directives (https://springismylove.wordpress.com/2015/09/03/derek-sivers-purge-the-vampires/):
    + HOW to be useful to others
      + Get Famous.
          Do everything in public and for the public.
          The more people you reach, the more useful you are.
          The opposite is hiding, which is of no use to anyone.
      + Get rich.
          Money is neutral proof that you are adding value to people's life.
          By getting rich, you are being useful as a side effect.
          Once rich, spend the money in ways that are even more useful to others.
          Then, getting rich is double useful.
      + Share strong opinions.
          Strong opinions are very useful to others.
          Those who are undecided or ambivalent can just adopt your stance.
          Those who disagree can solidify their stance by arguing against yours.
          Even if you invent an opinion for the sole sake of argument boldlly sharing a strong opinion is very useful to others.
      + Be Expensive.
          People given a placebo pill, are twice as likely to have their pain disappeared when told the pill is expensive.
          People who pay more for a ticket, are more likely to attend  performance.
          People who pay more for a value or service, value it more and get more use out of it.
    + How to thrive in an unknowable future 1:35
      + Prepare for the worst.
      + Expect disaster.
      + Own as little as possible.
      + Choose opportunity, not loyalty.
      + Choose the plan with the most options.
      + Avoid planning.
    + How to stop being rich and happy
      + Prioritize lifestyle design.

Develop a single page blood donation management system to facilitate the patients from all around the world, find blood donors near them.


Functional Specifications:

The app will provide a bridge between the patients and the volunteer blood donors.

The index page of application would load a map. Preferably it should be navigated to visitors’ location or the user can use search to navigate.

For Donors:

Donors can find their location and tap/click on it. On clicking it should open a form in popup, where the donor can add the following information:

First NameLast NameContact NumberEmail Address Blood Group

All these fields should have proper validation i.e. proper email address and a proper telephone number (+xx xxx xxxx xxx | 00xx xxx xxxx xxx).

On submitting the form a success message should be shown to user and his information along with his address, ip and geographical coordinates should be saved in database.
A unique private link should be generated and displayed to him, from where he can edit or delete his posting.

For Patients:

The map on index page should show all the posts in database as small pins at their respective coordinates. These pins should be lazy loaded, so only the pins that belong to the visible area of map should be loaded. As the user navigates the map, more pins should load accordingly.

On clicking any pin, a popup should appear displaying the donor’s information. In place of email and phone number, there should be a text (click to show). When the user clicks on this text, it should replace with the respective information. (This is to avoid bots from reading donor’s email address and contact information)

If any pin changes (a user made change to his post or deleted it) The change should be visible real time to other users.


Requirements
A single page architecture of data driven app, using MEAN stack.

Feel free to chose between Angular 2 or REACT as your front end framework.

Index page should mainly contain a map using ArcGIS

The postings should be real time, using sockets via socket.io

MongoDb NoSQL database should be used.

Unit tests should be written, where necessary.

A design document that describes

System design (component interaction diagram).

All the technologies, libraries and APIs used to develop the application.

Any other technical details you would like to share.

A readme file containing:

Steps to initialize and run the application.

Any missing requirements.

Any feedback you can give for improvements in assignment

A link to live hosted version of application. (AWS or Heroku)

Source code of the application.

Failing to follow these rules will invalidate your submission and you will not be evaluated.

To be evaluated
System Design.

Screen Designs.

Used technologies.

Fulfillment of building, deploying and running your application.

Implementing all mentioned functionalities.

Code quality (style, documentation and performance).

Fulfillment of unit tests.

Delivery / What to submit
Please, read and follow this section carefully. Any delivery that does not follow this section will score much less or simply won't be evaluated.

First of all, review Delivery Instructions (Sent to your personal mail), which describes general delivery process. Delivery for this assignment should consist of:Archive named <your_name – FSD>.zip containing the following:

README.txt -> Contains instructions and feedback.

Design.doc -> Contains your solution design and technologies.

Demo.txt -> Contains link to live version on application.

Code Folder -> Contains your solution.

Tests Folder -> Contains all tests.

So the resulting structure of your delivery should be:

<your_name - FSD>.zip \ README.txt

<your_name - FSD>.zip \ Design.doc

<your_name - FSD>.zip \ Demo.txt

<your_name - FSD>.zip \ Code\

<your_name - FSD>.zip \ TESTS\


ATTENTION! YOUR APPLICATION WILL BE REJECTED IF IT:

- Does not compile
- Does not contain unit tests
- Unit tests are failing


Good luck!
